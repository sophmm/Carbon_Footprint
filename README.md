# How can you reduce your UK Carbon footprint? 

### Installation 
The code uses the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.8.8. 

### Project Motivation 

After COP26, we are all aware we need to reduce CO2 emissions globally. We care about the environment but are not sure which products we buy contribute the most to the UK carbon footprint, and where in the world the emissions are originate from. What can we do to help the environment and reduce our carbon footprint? 

This code performs exploratory data analysis and some simple machine learning techniques to answer 3 key questions:

1.	Which products contribute the most to your UK carbon emission footprint? 
2.	Where do these products come from globally?
3.	Is there a change over time in where products come from overall and for individual products?
